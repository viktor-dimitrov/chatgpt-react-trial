# ChatGPT React Trial

Welcome to ChatGPT React Trial, a project that leverages OpenAI's GPT-3 model for chatbot functionality. This project is designed to work in conjunction with a custom Express server that you can clone from [Glitch-Express](https://github.com/viktor-dimitrov/Glitch-Express.git).

## Project Overview

ChatGPT React Trial is a web application that allows users to interact with a chatbot powered by OpenAI's GPT-3 model. It provides a simple and user-friendly interface for having conversations with the AI chatbot.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - JavaScript runtime environment
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) - Node.js package manager

## Installation

To get started with ChatGPT React Trial, follow these steps:

1. Clone the Glitch-Express server repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/viktor-dimitrov/Glitch-Express.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the server directory:

   ```bash
   cd Glitch-Express
   ```

3. Install server dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the server directory and set your OpenAI API key:

   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

   Replace `your_api_key_here` with your actual OpenAI API key.

5. Start the server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

6. With the server running, you can now start the ChatGPT React Trial project.

## Usage

1. Clone the ChatGPT React Trial project repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/viktor-dimitrov/chatgpt-react-trial.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd chatgpt-react-trial
   ```

3. Install project dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the React application:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. Open your web browser and access the application at http://localhost:3000.

Now you can interact with the ChatGPT React Trial chatbot in your browser.

## Important Note

This project relies on an API key for OpenAI's GPT-3, which must be obtained from [OpenAI](https://beta.openai.com/signup/). Ensure you have the API key properly configured in the `.env` file of the server (Glitch-Express) to enable the chatbot functionality.
